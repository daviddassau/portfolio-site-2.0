# David's Portfolio Site | Wordpress

This is my portfolio site as a software developer. It contains the following:
- A **Home/landing** page, with a quick overview of myself, my experience, and contact information.
- An **About Me** page, with a more in-depth look into myself, and my passions for programming and just life in general.
- A **Professional History/Education** page with a summary of my work experience, as well as my educational background.
- A **Projects** page with a list of all my big projects I've completed for either myself or my clients.
